# Setup

This is the recommended and currently the only supported option to setup a Zero-OS cluster.

In order to have a full Zero-OS cluster you'll need to perform the following steps:
1. [Create a Docker container with a JumpScale9](#create-a-jumpscale9-docker-container)
2. [ItsYou.online preparation](#itsyou.online-preparation)
3. [Install the Zero-OS Orchestrator](#install-the-orchestrator)
4. [Create a JWT](#create-the-jwt)
5. [Start the AYS Configuration service](#setup-the-ays-configuration-service)
6. [Setup the backplane network](#setup-the-backplane-network)
7. [Start the AYS Bootstrap service](#setup-the-ays-bootstrap-service)
8. [Boot your Zero-OS nodes](#boot-your-zero-os-nodes)


## Create a JumpScale9 Docker container

Create the Docker container with the JumpScale9 development environment by following the documentation at https://github.com/Jumpscale/developer#jumpscale-9.

> **Important:** Make sure you set the `GIGBRANCH` environment variable to **9.0.3** before running `jsinit.sh`. This version of 0-orchestrator will only work with this version of JumpScale.

> **Important:**: Make sure to build the js9 docker with `js9_build -l` and not directly start the docker with `js9_start -b` cause this will not install all the requires libraries.


## ItsYou.online preparation

If not already done so, first register on https://www.ItsYou.online.

Once registered create an API key:

And then create an ItsYou.online organization:

## Install the Orchestrator

SSH into your JumpScale9 Docker container and install the Orchestrator using the [`install-orchestrator.sh`](../../scripts/install-orchestrator.sh) script.

Before actually performing the Orchestrator installation the script will first join the Docker container into the ZeroTier management network that will be used to manage the Zero-OS nodes in your cluster.
The orchestrator by default installs Caddy and runs using HTTPS. If the domain is passed, it will try to create certificates for that domain, unless `--development` is used, then it will use self-signed certificates.

This script takes the following parameters:
- `BRANCH`: 0-orchestrator development branch
- `ZEROTIERNWID`: ZeroTier network ID
- `ZEROTIERTOKEN`: ZeroTier API token
- `ITSYOUONLINEORG`: Itsyouonline organization to authenticate against
- `DOMAIN`: Optional domain to listen on if this is ommited caddy will listen on the zerotier network with a selfsigned certificate
- `--development`: When domain is passed and you want to force a selfsigned certificate

So:
```bash
cd /tmp
export BRANCH="1.1.0-alpha-4"
export ZEROTIERNWID="<Your ZeroTier network ID>"
export ZEROTIERTOKEN="<Your ZeroTier token>"
export ITSYOUONLINEORG="<ItsYou.online organization>"
export DOMAIN="<Your domain name>"
curl -o install-orchestrator.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zero-os/0-orchestrator/${BRANCH}/scripts/install-orchestrator.sh
bash install-orchestrator.sh $BRANCH $ZEROTIERNWID $ZEROTIERTOKEN <$ITSYOUONLINEORG> [<$DOMAIN> [--development]]
```

In order to see the full log details while `install-orchestrator.sh` executes:
```shell
tail -s /tmp/install.log
```

> **Important:**
> - The ZeroTier network needs to be a private network
> - The script will wait until you authorize your JumpScale9 Docker container into the network


Once installed a new TMUX session will have been created, in order to attach to it execute:
```bash
tmux at
```

![](tmux.png)

You'll see three TMUX session windows, one for each of the following processes:
- AYS Server
- Orchestrator
- Caddy Server, for SSL offloading

You can switch between the TMUX session windows using `CTRL-B` and then `0`, `1` or `3`.

In order to detach for the TMUX session use `CTRL-B` and then `d`.


## Create a JWT

As a preparation to the next step, which requires using the AYS command line tool, we need to create a JSON Web token (JWT).

Since AYS is protected with a JWT, you have to generate a JWT token so the AYS command line tool can authenticate against the AYS server.

The AYS command line tool provides and easy way to do it:

```shell
ays generatetoken --clientid {CLIENT_ID} --clientsecret {CLIENT_SECRET} --organization $ITSYOUONLINEORG
```

`CLIENT_ID` AND `CLIENT_SECRET` have to be generated on [ItsYou.online](https://itsyou.online), as discused above.

This command will output something like:
```shell
# Generated Token, please run to use in client:
export JWT='eyJhbGciOiJFUzM4NCIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhenAiOiJLa0Y0c3IyUll4cXVYWTZlWjVtMWtic0dTbVJRIiwiZXhwIjoxNDk4MTM0MDMyLCJpc3MiOiJpdHN5b3VvbmxpbmUiLCJyZWZyZXNoX3Rva2VuIjoiU2xxLWVfY9ktSjBEalRDbmZPNzA1SDN1ZFN5UyIsInNjb3BlIjpbInVzZXI6bWVtYmVyb2Y6Z3JlZW5pdGdsb2JlLmVudmlyb25tZW50cy5iZS1nOC0zIl0sInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiemFpYm9uIn0.sKVUHPxSb6rxOMx1DKV8w0T0dpyuMya4fBgOV66VFl6-R4p53crvSkHidXRjsKbgbyxV2stsbxV67mo5JPvRN9uaf-pnJ9cXxs74lSq8OoFwre6aG9pG0JPmVt9uMy56'
```

Copy the export statetement and execute it in your terminal. This will allow the AYS command line tool to be authenticate against the AYS RESTful API from now one.


## Start the AYS Configuration service

In order for the Orchestrator to know which flists and version of JumpScale to use, and which Zero-OS version is required on the nodes, create the following blueprint in `/optvar/cockpit_repos/orchestrator-server/blueprints/configuration.bp`:

```yaml
configuration__main:
  configurations:
  - key: '0-core-version'
    value: '1.1.0-alpha-4'
  - key: 'js-version'
    value: '9.0.3'
  - key: 'gw-flist'
    value: 'https://hub.gig.tech/gig-official-apps/zero-os-gw-1.1.0-alpha-3.flist'
  - key: 'ovs-flist'
    value: 'https://hub.gig.tech/gig-official-apps/ovs-1.1.0-alpha-3.flist'
  - key: '0-disk-flist'
    value: 'https://hub.gig.tech/gig-official-apps/0-disk-1.1.0-alpha-3.flist'
  - key: 'jwt-token'
    value: '<The JWT generted at the previous step>'
  - key: 'jwt-key'
    value: 'MHYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEACIDYgAES5X8XrfKdx9gYayFITc89wad4usrk0n27MjiGYvqalizeSWTHEpnd7oea9IQ8T5oJjMVH5cc0H5tFSKilFFeh//wngxIyny66+Vq5t5B0V0Ehy01+2ceEon2Y0XDkIKv'    
```

See [Versioning](versioning.md) for more details about the AYS Configuration service.

After creating this blueprint, issue the following AYS command to install the Configuration service:
```bash
cd /optvar/cockpit_repos/orchestrator-server
ays blueprint configuration.bp
```

## Setup the backplane network

This optional setup allows you to interconnect your nodes using the (if available) 10GE+ network infrastructure. Skip this step if you don't have this in your setup.

Create a new blueprint `/optvar/cockpit_repos/orchestrator-server/blueprints/network.bp` and depending on the available 10GE+ network infrastructure specify following configuration:

### G8 setup
```yaml
network.zero-os__storage:
  vlanTag: 101
  cidr: "192.168.58.0/24"
```
> **Important:** Change the vlanTag and the cidr according to the needs of your environment.

### Switchless setup
```yaml
network.switchless__storage:
  vlanTag: 101
  cidr: "192.168.58.0/24"
```
> **Important:** Change the vlanTag and the cidr according to the needs of your environment.

See [Switchless Setup](switchless.md) for instructions on how to interconnect the nodes in case there is no Gigabit Ethernet switch.

### Packet.net setup

```yaml
network.publicstorage__storage:
```

After creating this blueprint, issue the following AYS command to start the AYS Network service:
```shell
cd /optvar/cockpit_repos/orchestrator-server
ays blueprint network.bp
```

## Start the AYS Bootstrap service

Then we need to start the AYS Bootstrap service which authorizes ZeroTier join requests from Zero-OS nodes if they meet the conditions as set in the Configuration blueprint. The Bootstrap service will also deploy the (optional) storage network (discussed above) when bootstrapping the nodes.

Edit `/optvar/cockpit_repos/orchestrator-server/blueprints/bootstrap.bp` as follows:
```yaml
bootstrap.zero-os__grid1:
  zerotierNetID: '<Your ZeroTier network id>'
  zerotierToken: '<Your ZeroTier token>'
  wipedisks: true # indicate you want to wipe the disks of the nodes when adding them
  networks:
    - storage
```

Now issue the following AYS commands to install the Bootstrap service:
```shell
cd /optvar/cockpit_repos/orchestrator-server
ays service delete -n grid1 -y
ays blueprint bootstrap.bp
ays run create -y
```

## Boot your Zero-OS nodes

The final step is to boot your Zero-OS nodes into your ZeroTier network.

Via iPXE from the following URL: `https://bootstrap.gig.tech/ipxe/1.1.0-alpha-4/<Your ZeroTier network ID>/organization=${ITSYOUONLINEORG}`

Or download your ISO from the following URL: `https://bootstrap.gig.tech/iso/1.1.0-alpha-4/<Your ZeroTier network ID>/organization=${ITSYOUONLINEORG}`

See to the [0-core documentation](https://github.com/zero-os/0-core/blob/1.1.0-alpha-4/docs/booting/booting.md) for more information on booting Zero-OS.
